"xml.dom.pulldom" --- Support for building partial DOM trees
************************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/xml/dom/pulldom.py

======================================================================

The "xml.dom.pulldom" module provides a "pull parser" which can also
be asked to produce DOM-accessible fragments of the document where
necessary. The basic concept involves pulling "events" from a stream
of incoming XML and processing them. In contrast to SAX which also
employs an event-driven processing model together with callbacks, the
user of a pull parser is responsible for explicitly pulling events
from the stream, looping over those events until either processing is
finished or an error condition occurs.

Note:

  If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data, see XML
  security.

Changed in version 3.7.1: The SAX parser no longer processes general
external entities by default to increase security by default. To
enable processing of external entities, pass a custom parser instance
in:

   from xml.dom.pulldom import parse
   from xml.sax import make_parser
   from xml.sax.handler import feature_external_ges

   parser = make_parser()
   parser.setFeature(feature_external_ges, True)
   parse(filename, parser=parser)

Example:

   from xml.dom import pulldom

   doc = pulldom.parse('sales_items.xml')
   for event, node in doc:
       if event == pulldom.START_ELEMENT and node.tagName == 'item':
           if int(node.getAttribute('price')) > 50:
               doc.expandNode(node)
               print(node.toxml())

"event" is one of the following constants, and "node" is the node
which the event is about. The nodes implement the "xml.dom"
interfaces; they are created by the DOM implementation given to
"PullDOM", which is "xml.dom.minidom" by default.

xml.dom.pulldom.START_DOCUMENT
xml.dom.pulldom.END_DOCUMENT

   The start and the end of the document. *node* is the "Document".

xml.dom.pulldom.START_ELEMENT
xml.dom.pulldom.END_ELEMENT

   The start tag and the end tag of an element. *node* is the
   "Element".

xml.dom.pulldom.CHARACTERS

   Character data. *node* is the "Text" node.

xml.dom.pulldom.IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE

   White space in element content, as declared in the DTD. *node* is
   the "Text" node.

xml.dom.pulldom.COMMENT

   A comment. *node* is the "Comment" node.

xml.dom.pulldom.PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION

   A processing instruction. *node* is the "ProcessingInstruction"
   node.

Since the document is treated as a "flat" stream of events, the
document "tree" is implicitly traversed and the desired elements are
found regardless of their depth in the tree. In other words, one does
not need to consider hierarchical issues such as recursive searching
of the document nodes, although if the context of elements were
important, one would either need to maintain some context-related
state (i.e. remembering where one is in the document at any given
point) or to make use of the "DOMEventStream.expandNode()" method and
switch to DOM-related processing.

class xml.dom.pulldom.PullDOM(documentFactory=None)

   Subclass of "xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler" which turns SAX events
   into the events of the pull parser. The nodes are created, but they
   are not added to the tree, unless "expandNode()" is called.
   *documentFactory*, if given, is a DOM implementation used to create
   the document; by default the implementation of "xml.dom.minidom" is
   used.

class xml.dom.pulldom.SAX2DOM(documentFactory=None)

   Subclass of "PullDOM" which also adds every created node to the
   tree, so that the complete document is built.

xml.dom.pulldom.parse(stream_or_string, parser=None, bufsize=None)

   Return a "DOMEventStream" from the given input. *stream_or_string*
   may be either a file name, or a file-like object. *parser*, if
   given, must be an "XMLReader" object. This function will change the
   document handler of the parser and activate namespace support;
   other parser configuration (like setting an entity resolver) must
   have been done in advance.

If you have XML in a string, you can use the "parseString()" function
instead:

xml.dom.pulldom.parseString(string, parser=None)

   Return a "DOMEventStream" that represents the *string*. *string*
   must be a "str" instance; to parse bytes, pass a binary file object
   to "parse()".

xml.dom.pulldom.default_bufsize

   Default value for the *bufsize* parameter to "parse()".

   The value of this variable can be changed before calling "parse()"
   and the new value will take effect.


DOMEventStream Objects
======================

class xml.dom.pulldom.DOMEventStream(stream, parser, bufsize)

   Produce the events for the data read from the file object *stream*
   by the "XMLReader" *parser*. The data is read by *bufsize* bytes,
   or characters for a text stream, at a time.

   Changed in version 3.11: Support for "__getitem__()" method has
   been removed.

   getEvent()

      Return the next "(event, node)" tuple, or "None" at the end of
      the document. See above for the events and the corresponding
      nodes. The current node does not contain information about its
      children, unless "expandNode()" is called.

   expandNode(node)

      Expands all children of *node* into *node*. Example:

         from xml.dom import pulldom

         xml = '<html><title>Foo</title> <p>Some text <div>and more</div></p> </html>'
         doc = pulldom.parseString(xml)
         for event, node in doc:
             if event == pulldom.START_ELEMENT and node.tagName == 'p':
                 # Following statement only prints '<p/>'
                 print(node.toxml())
                 doc.expandNode(node)
                 # Following statement prints node with all its children '<p>Some text <div>and more</div></p>'
                 print(node.toxml())

   reset()

      Discard the events which are not read yet and prepare the object
      for parsing a new document.

   clear()

      Release the parser and the document. The stream is not closed,
      and the object can no longer be used.
