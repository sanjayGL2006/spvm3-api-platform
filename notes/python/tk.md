Graphical user interfaces with Tk
*********************************

Tk/Tcl has long been an integral part of Python.  It provides a robust
and platform independent windowing toolkit, that is available to
Python programmers using the "tkinter" package, and its extension, the
"tkinter.ttk" module.

The "tkinter" package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of
Tcl/Tk. To use "tkinter", you don't need to write Tcl code, but you
will need to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl
documentation. "tkinter" is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk
widgets as Python classes.

"tkinter"'s chief virtues are that it is fast, and that it usually
comes bundled with Python. Although its standard documentation is
weak, good material is available, which includes: references,
tutorials, a book and others. "tkinter" is also famous for having an
outdated look and feel, which has been vastly improved in Tk 8.5.
Nevertheless, there are many other GUI libraries that you could be
interested in. The Python wiki lists several alternative GUI
frameworks and tools.
